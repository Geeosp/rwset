Use the following commands to try it out:

$> ./build
$> ./run

This will show method dependencies across a sample set of cases that
can be found under the folder "src/examples".  The script "build"
compiles the source code and generates a .jar file containing the
application under analysis (currently, those under "src/examples").
Our implementation requires the subject to be packaged this way.  Open
the script "run" to find the arguments that the main class
"depend.Main" takes on input.


Important details:

There are some issues related to the use of WALA in Java versions
>1.7.  In case, you use *nix and you have a version of the JDK prior
to 1.7, please, set your environment to use it with the following
commands.  You will be prompted with a question for which version of
the Java JVM you want to use.

Set the JVM version:

$> sudo update-alternatives --config java

And do the same for the Java compiler:

$> sudo update-alternatives --config javac

enjoy,
