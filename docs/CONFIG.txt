=========== Version of Java ============

There are some issues related to the current version we are using of
WALA in Java versions >1.7.  

........For *nix users

In case, you use *nix and you have a version of the JDK prior to 1.7,
please, set your environment to use it with the following commands.
You will be prompted with a question for which version of the Java JVM
you want to use.

Set the JVM version:

$> sudo update-alternatives --config java

Similar to the Java compiler:

$> sudo update-alternatives --config javac

........For MAC users

=========== Configuration files ============

If you are a *nix user, you don't need to do anything special.

For Mac users: update the property "java_runtime_dir" on file
<rootdir>/dat/wala.properties to point to your jre installation, which
is certainly under "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/" (please
check).
